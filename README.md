### Brief Overview
Sergei, a newcomer to a bizarre prison where dance is enforced as rehabilitation, finds himself trapped in a nightmarish cycle of absurdity and violence. After a brutal assault in the showers, he is "rescued" by the enigmatic Master and drawn into the fanatical Male Legion, where dance becomes a test of strength and loyalty. As reality warps through circus arenas, disco floors, and ballet halls, Sergei and a mysterious Lenka—his childhood dance partner—attempt to dismantle the oppressive order with chaotic rebellion. Their escape leads to a meta-awakening: the world is a fiction, and Sergei rejects the dance, stepping beyond the narrative’s edge into an uncertain void. This story blends surreal horror, psychological depth, and metafiction into a haunting exploration of identity and resistance.
